## Installation

Run "serverless deploy" to install the project

## What is installed

This project when run as configured will create the following:
Lambda function -- Cost ~$.0005/day.  
DynamoDB table -- Cost $.59/month.  
RDS instance -- Cost $.017/hr.  

## Configuring Auto Park

Go to the created DynamoDB table "rds_autoparking_config" and find the item for the day of the week you want to update.  Change the "exclude" attribute to "False" and change the "all_day" attribute to either "On", "Off", or "Schedule".  "On" or "Off" will keep your rds instance on or off all day.  Setting to "Schedule" will turn your rds instance on if the current time is in between the start_hour and stop_hour attributes and turn it off if it is outside of those hours.
